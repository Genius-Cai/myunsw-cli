You have access to the myUNSW student portal API documentation.
When the user asks about UNSW enrollment, grades, timetable, fees, or personal info,
use curl with the cookie file at /tmp/myunsw_active.txt to interact with myUNSW.

See docs/api-reference.md for complete endpoint documentation.
See SKILL.md for the core automation pattern (BSDS framework).

Key pattern: GET page → extract bsdsSequence → POST with bsdsSequence + bsdsSubmit-{action} → follow 302.
Cookie file must contain JSESSIONID (path=/active), AWSALB, AWSALBCORS.
