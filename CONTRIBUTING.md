## What We Need Help With

### High Priority
- **Python/Node CLI wrapper** — turn curl examples into a proper CLI tool
- **Better HTML parsing** — more robust extraction of grades, fees, timetable data
- **Session refresh automation** — explore if CAS ticket reuse is possible

### Medium Priority
- **More AI platform integrations** — Copilot, Aider, etc.
- **Additional endpoint discovery** — there may be undocumented endpoints
- **Error handling patterns** — catalog common error responses

### Nice to Have
- **Postgrad/Research student testing** — current docs are based on undergrad access
- **Multi-program student testing** — edge cases with multiple enrollments
- **Browser extension** — auto-extract cookies and save to cookie file

## Guidelines

- **No credentials in code** — never commit cookies, passwords, or student IDs
- **Test with your own account** — don't access others' data
- **Document your findings** — include curl commands, response examples, and edge cases
- **Keep it simple** — this project is about documentation, not over-engineering

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful. We're all UNSW students trying to make enrollment less painful.
